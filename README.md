To begin, open the Zip Open Builder. Before proceeding, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Once you have confirmed the presence of Python, proceed to click on SUpdater. It is essential to run this updater because the software requires updates approximately every week to maintain optimal performance and security.

After the update process is complete, proceed to run Seroxin. Upon launching Seroxin, you should be greeted with a screen offering various options such as Tools, Settings, or Deploy. Select the "Deploy" option.

Next, enter the port number provided by Playit. Once you have entered the correct port number, you can start the process of ratting. Make sure to follow any additional prompts or instructions that appear to ensure a smooth setup and operation.
